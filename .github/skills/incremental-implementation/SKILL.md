# Incremental Implementation

## Overview

Build in thin vertical slices — implement one piece, test it, verify it, then expand. Avoid implementing an entire feature in one pass. Each increment should leave the system in a working, testable state. This is the execution discipline that makes large features manageable.

## When to Use

- Implementing any multi-file change
- Building a new feature from a task breakdown
- Refactoring existing code
- Any time you're tempted to write more than ~100 lines before testing

**When NOT to use:** Single-file, single-function changes where the scope is already minimal.

## The Increment Cycle

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                      │
│   Implement ──→ Test ──→ Verify ──┐  │
│       ▲                           │  │
│       └───── Commit ◄─────────────┘  │
│              │                       │
│              ▼                       │
│          Next slice                  │
│                                      │
└──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

For each slice:

1. **Implement** the smallest complete piece of functionality
2. **Test** — run the test suite (or write a test if none exists)
3. **Verify** — confirm the slice works as expected (tests pass, build succeeds, manual check)
4. **Commit** -- save your progress with a descriptive message (see `git-workflow-and-versioning` for atomic commit guidance)
5. **Move to the next slice** — carry forward, don't restart

## Slicing Strategies

### Vertical Slices (Preferred)

Build one complete path through the stack:

```
Slice 1: Create a user (DB schema + EF entity config + migration + API endpoint)
    → Tests pass, POST /users works end-to-end

Slice 2: Get user by external ID (query + API endpoint)
    → Tests pass, GET /users/{externalUserId} returns the user

Slice 3: Update user profile (domain method + command handler + endpoint)
    → Tests pass, PATCH /users/{externalUserId} persists changes

Slice 4: Add user address (new aggregate child + config + FK migration)
    → Tests pass, address association works
```

Each slice delivers working end-to-end functionality.

### Contract-First Slicing

When building a new endpoint:

```
Slice 0: Define the API contract (request/response records, OpenAPI annotations)
Slice 1: Implement domain logic (Value Objects, entity method) + unit tests
Slice 2: Implement infrastructure (EF config, migration, repository) + integration tests
Slice 3: Wire the endpoint in Program.cs + smoke test
```

### Risk-First Slicing

Tackle the riskiest or most uncertain piece first:

```
Slice 1: Prove the WebSocket connection works (highest risk)
Slice 2: Build real-time task updates on the proven connection
Slice 3: Add offline support and reconnection
```

If Slice 1 fails, you discover it before investing in Slices 2 and 3.

## Implementation Rules

### Rule 0: Simplicity First

Before writing any code, ask: "What is the simplest thing that could work?"

After writing code, review it against these checks:
- Can this be done in fewer lines?
- Are these abstractions earning their complexity?
- Would a staff engineer look at this and say "why didn't you just..."?
- Am I building for hypothetical future requirements, or the current task?

```
SIMPLICITY CHECK:
✗ Generic EventBus with middleware pipeline for one notification
✓ Simple function call

✗ Abstract factory pattern for two similar components
✓ Two straightforward components with shared utilities

✗ Config-driven form builder for three forms
✓ Three form components
```

Three similar lines of code is better than a premature abstraction. Implement the naive, obviously-correct version first. Optimize only after correctness is proven with tests.

### Rule 0.5: Scope Discipline

Touch only what the task requires.

Do NOT:
- "Clean up" code adjacent to your change
- Refactor imports in files you're not modifying
- Remove comments you don't fully understand
- Add features not in the spec because they "seem useful"
- Modernize syntax in files you're only reading

If you notice something worth improving outside your task scope, note it — don't fix it:

```
NOTICED BUT NOT TOUCHING:
- src/utils/format.ts has an unused import (unrelated to this task)
- The auth middleware could use better error messages (separate task)
→ Want me to create tasks for these?
```

### Rule 1: One Thing at a Time

Each increment changes one logical thing. Don't mix concerns:

**Bad:** One commit that adds a new component, refactors an existing one, and updates the build config.

**Good:** Three separate commits — one for each change.

### Rule 2: Keep It Compilable

After each increment, the project must build and existing tests must pass. Don't leave the codebase in a broken state between slices.

### Rule 3: Feature Flags for Incomplete Features

If a feature isn't ready for users but you need to merge increments:

```csharp
// Feature flag via configuration — no external dependency needed
var enableNewFlow = builder.Configuration.GetValue<bool>("Features:NewChannelFlow");

app.MapPost("/users/{id}/channels", async (...) =>
{
    if (enableNewFlow)
        return await _newHandler.HandleAsync(cmd);
    return await _legacyHandler.HandleAsync(cmd);
});
```

This lets you merge small increments to the main branch without exposing incomplete work.

### Rule 4: Safe Defaults

New code should default to safe, conservative behavior:

```csharp
// Safe: opt-in behavior via optional parameter
public static User Create(
    UserProfile userProfile,
    string? passwordHash,
    string? securityStamp,
    DateTimeOffset createdDatetime,
    bool sendWelcomeEmail = false)  // new flag, off by default
{
    // ...
}
```

### Rule 5: Rollback-Friendly

Each increment should be independently revertable:

- Additive changes (new files, new functions) are easy to revert
- Modifications to existing code should be minimal and focused
- Database migrations should have corresponding rollback migrations
- Avoid deleting something in one commit and replacing it in the same commit — separate them

## Working with Agents

When directing an agent to implement incrementally:

```
"Let's implement the create-user endpoint from the plan.

Start with just the Value Object (Email) and the domain factory method.
Don't touch the endpoint or infrastructure yet — we'll do those in the next slices.

After implementing, run `dotnet test` and `dotnet build` to verify nothing is broken."
```

Be explicit about what's in scope and what's NOT in scope for each increment.

## Increment Checklist

After each increment, verify:

- [ ] The change does one thing and does it completely
- [ ] All existing tests still pass (`dotnet test`)
- [ ] The build succeeds (`dotnet build --configuration Release`)
- [ ] No new compiler warnings introduced (`TreatWarningsAsErrors` is enabled globally)
- [ ] The new functionality works as expected
- [ ] The change is committed with a descriptive message

**Note:** Run each verification command after a change that could affect it. After a successful run, don't repeat the same command unless the code has changed since — re-running on unchanged code adds no information.

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "I'll test it all at the end" | Bugs compound. A bug in Slice 1 makes Slices 2-5 wrong. Test each slice. |
| "It's faster to do it all at once" | It *feels* faster until something breaks and you can't find which of 500 changed lines caused it. |
| "These changes are too small to commit separately" | Small commits are free. Large commits hide bugs and make rollbacks painful. |
| "I'll add the feature flag later" | If the feature isn't complete, it shouldn't be user-visible. Add the flag now. |
| "This refactor is small enough to include" | Refactors mixed with features make both harder to review and debug. Separate them. |
| "Let me run the build command again just to be sure" | After a successful run, repeating the same command adds nothing unless the code has changed since. Run it again after subsequent edits, not as reassurance. |

## Red Flags

- More than 100 lines of code written without running tests
- Multiple unrelated changes in a single increment
- "Let me just quickly add this too" scope expansion
- Skipping the test/verify step to move faster
- Build or tests broken between increments
- Large uncommitted changes accumulating
- Building abstractions before the third use case demands it
- Touching files outside the task scope "while I'm here"
- Creating new utility files for one-time operations
- Running the same build/test command twice in a row without any intervening code change

## Verification

After completing all increments for a task:

- [ ] Each increment was individually tested and committed
- [ ] The full test suite passes: `dotnet test`
- [ ] The build is clean: `dotnet build --configuration Release`
- [ ] The feature works end-to-end as specified
- [ ] No uncommitted changes remain
